Washington ( CNN ) President Donald Trump ’s firing of FBI Director James Comey has uncoiled a whole administration ’s worth of shocks , contradictions and blockbuster moments . shocks, contradictions and blockbuster moments will continue to reverberate next week and beyond because the issues involved are fundamental to American democracy , challenging the credibility of the White House and the vital legal institutions that sustain government . As always in politics , timing is everything , and the timing here raises questions about the use and possible abuse of presidential power : Why did Trump do it ? And more importantly , why now ? Orchestrating the chaos , as always , was Trump himself , who largely stayed out of public view last week but managed to incite pandemonium nonetheless . In a dizzying sequence of events , sacked acting Attorney General Sally Yates warned in Senate testimony Monday that    security adviser Michael Flynn was a ripe blackmail target for Russia while in office . The President suddenly fired FBI Director James Comey on Tuesday , and then blindsided his the President his The President reasoning before sabotaging the White House press operation that was trying to defend him The President Amid reports he The President a loyalty pledge from Comey FBI Director James Comey critics warned Trump was guilty of a grotesque abuse of power , or even worse . But the President was not done . He The President that Comey ’s investigation into links between his presidential campaign and Comey were indeed the reason he was fired . Comey a Friday morning tweetstorm , he The President to suggest he The President a    White House taping operation , and told Comey to stay mum Comey Next , he The President ending press briefings because it ’s impossible for his The President team to keep up with the whiplash of his The President presidency . Trump ’s behavior provoked confusion and criticism in Washington . But the President is defiant and may have had his detractors in mind the President he delivered a commencement the President Saturday at Liberty University , in Virginia . " No one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sideline saying why it ca n’t be No one , " Trump said . " Nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic . " View from afar , Meanwhile , out in the country , the political contagion is spreading .   In North Dakota , tempers boiled over at a town hall event hosted by Rep. Kevin Cramer . A man demanded to know whether the rich would benefit from the repeal of Obamacare and was escorted out by police after trying to shove a wad of cash into Cramer ’s collar . Rep. Kevin Cramer Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan was shouted down by constituents shouting " health care for all . "   GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur , who helped pass the Obamacare repeal bill , walked into a metaphorical bear pit in his New Jersey district . Republican Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan Open your eyes ! " screamed one    voter . In West Virginia , a reporter was arrested after firing a string of questions at Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price . At times , in Washington and elsewhere , it seemed as thought the country ’s political equilibrium Washington grave risk . It ’s now normal to observe it Trump is not like a conventional politician , that the point of his political project is to flout Trump and shake up the cozy establishment and that the press takes him too literally . And when Trump behaves in a way that Trump the media and Washington establishment types running around with their hair on fire , his the media and Washington base of voters who Trump him to the White House see Trump mission accomplished . Loyalty , There ’s also no sign that congressional leaders are ready to desert him . House Speaker Paul Ryan Trump for instance , said Friday : " I ’ve decided I ’m not going to comment on the tweets of the day or the hour . "    Trump went back to his seemingly impervious well of political Trump Friday , in a fundraising drive Friday to supporters in which he said : " Let ’s Trump the hypocrites , liars Trump and ’elites’ of Washington that the American people are dead serious about our mission to DRAIN THE SWAMP the American people " But despite the loyalty of his base and for all the cacophony of the last three months , and the riotous campaign in 2016 , the last week has seemed different . It felt at times that the the last week House was spinning off its political axis , that the the White House was isolated even from his own staff and that there the President little rhyme or reason behind his increasingly erratic statements . Trump the President often frazzled but loyal press secretary Sean Spicer was even asked in his daily briefing on Friday whether Sean Spicer was " out of control Trump " " That ’s , frankly , offensive , " Spicer said .   Yet , Sean Spicer extreme have been the events of the last few days that such a question     which many would view as outrageous in more normal times     did n’t seem out of bounds .   Wild ride , While Trump has taken America on a Trump ride since taking office , things did appear to get substantially more surreal and serious this week , with the possibility even looming that the President had edged closer to legal jeopardy with his stunning decision to can Comey the President he was overseeing the Russia probe the President   Spicer ’s    Sarah Huckabee Sanders , meanwhile , made a series of statements about Comey ’s popularity within the bureau Comey scope of the FBI investigation that were comprehensively refuted by acting FBI chief Andrew McCabe in congressional testimony on Thursday . Some Republicans are worried about the trajectory of Trump ’s presidency amid concern that a distracted White House could squander its opportunity to use a GOP majority a distracted White House reshape the country ’s politics . " This is ridiculous , it is not tenable and Republicans . This just politically , this can not last , so go This and start holding the President accountable , the bogeyman is not going to come out from under your bed , " Amanda Carpenter , a former communications aide to Sen. Ted Cruz said on " Anderson Cooper 360 " on Friday . " Donald Trump ’s special police are not going to come get you in the middle of the night . "   " If you say , ’Mr . President , please respect the three branches of government . Please respect the American institution as it ’s supposed to work’ . .. the American institution will be much better off , " said Carpenter , a CNN commentator . But beyond the politics , there ’s another element to the Trump presidency that makes it so discombobulating Donald Trump many people . the Trump presidency Thanks to the President ’s mastery of social media , it ’s hard to escape him . He sometimes seems to be the President’s on the President’s device , from your iPhone to your laptop to your television , and thus barges into countless conversations or social occasion . If nothing else , by the end of his presidency , America may face the the President’s equivalent post traumatic stress disorder . And the societal damage from Trump ’s perpetual war on institutions like the intelligence agencies , the courts and the media might take may years to assess . In that sense , Friday ’s tweet storm blasting Comey and the " fake media " was just the capstone of a madcap week . Timothy Naftali , a CNN historian and former director of the Nixon Library , suggested that the President would do well to reconsider his approach . " I believe the the President of the United States needs to think about his credibility , " Naftali told CNN the President Kate Bolduan , the President to CNN ’s response to the investigation into alleged Russian election meddling . Though there was no evidence he was guilty of anything , Trump the President acting like he is , Trump’s said . " the President is bigger the President him , he is our head of the President , the President is our bald eagle , he the President our our . Perhaps there the President be a time for a little bit of a moment and little reflection . .. perhaps he might want to think about his the President more seriously than he has the President to now , " the President said . Credibility , But it the President not just Trump whose credibility seemed tarnished after his week . The reputation of his Trump shop has also taken a Trump .   The suddenness of Comey ’s firing took the White House Trump by surprise , but they quickly built a rationale that the reason the White House communications team was gone was a damning report on Trump handling of the Hillary Clinton email probe Trump by the new deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein . It did n’t seem remotely credible , but at least it was something . Within hours the tale It unraveling , but not before Vice President Mike Pence had put his own reputation on the line by peddling Vice President Mike Pence to reporters on Capitol Hill . Even It White House aides insisted repeatedly the firing had White House do with Russia Comey’s firing were finally and disastrously undermined by their own boss Even though White House aides insisted repeatedly " In fact when I decided Even though White House aides insisted repeatedly just do it , I said to myself , I said , ’You know , this Russia Russia with Trump and Russia Russia a    story Trump’s an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won,’ " Trump told NBC in an interview . the Democrats comments Trump’s an already dicey job for Spicer ’s team all ’You impossible . Spicer I think the credibility is gone , and I ’m really sorry to say that , " said John Kirby , a former State Department and Pentagon spokesman who is Kirby , I think it is shot , and I do n’t know how they ever get it back , " Kirby said . Some Republicans are meanwhile worried that the a crisis of credibility that has eroded in a fraught political time for the White House a crisis of credibility leave the the White House an inevitable international or the White House flares . " Having the President undermine the credibility of his staff makes their the President not just today his own staff forward the President " said Republican strategist Doug Heye on CNN . " This White House has had a lot of CNN the White House real true crisis yet . When that crisis hits , Sean Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders , they need credibility in front Sean Spicer reporters who are Sarah Huckabee Sanders gunning after them and the President hurt them the President That is a real not a real true crisis yet this White House .
