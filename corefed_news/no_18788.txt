’’ ’In a sprawling   writer and political commentator Andrew Sullivan offers something of an ultimatum : The GOP elite " must take the fight to Trump at every opportunity , unite with Democrats and Independents against Trump , and be prepared to sacrifice one election in order to save Democrats and Independents party and Democrats and Independents county . " ’ ’That is because , Andrew Sullivan ultimately concludes , ’ ’Sullivan finds a model for the current state of affairs in American politics in antiquity   —    namely , Plato’ ’s " Republic . " ’ ’The gist of Plato’ ’s argument , by way of Andrew Sullivan , is that , given enough time , democracy becomes distrustful of elites to the point that " There is no kowtowing to authority . .. let alone to political experience or expertise .

" ’ ’The upshot , apparently , is that Trump was right about one thing   —    the nomination system   and Sullivan urges for the exploitation of that very rigging : " The GOP elites have every right to deploy whatever rules or procedural roadblocks The GOP elites can muster , and The GOP elites should refuse to be intimidated . " ’ " Business Insider ’s Josh Barro called a rule change in Colorado ’s primary system   which seems to be Sullivan ’s very point . If Josh Barro is to be believed   —    a     —    too much democracy is what got Americans into this mess in the first place . " ’In a sprawling    cover story in . .. ’
