PARIS ( AFP )   —    Such is Marine Le Pen ’s aversion to the European Union that the French right wing leader demanded the removal of right wing    flag from a TV studio before agreeing to a recent interview . [ Her chief rival in the race for the French presidency , centrist Emmanuel Macron , pointedly waved an EU flag from the podium at a campaign rally the next day .   Love it or loathe it , the European Union has become a    issue in the election , fanning fears far beyond France in the wake of Britain ’s Brexit vote that a " Frexit " could doom the     bloc . " Rarely has the European issue held such a    place on all the candidates’ platforms as in this electoral campaign , " said analyst Pierre Vimont of the Carnegie Europe think tank . In the five years since France ’s last presidential vote , the Carnegie Europe has seen a massive migrant crisis and a rise in populism , both contributing to the Brexit vote . None of the four main French candidates can afford to be neutral on the EU , whether None of the four main French candidates portray the EU as the source of all woes or a guarantee of peace and stability . Like Macron , conservative candidate Francois Fillon is bullish on Brussels , highlighting the    leadership axis and defending the euro . Both candidates met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the campaign . Arrayed on the other side are Le Pen , who advocates leaving the EU immediately , and    candidate    Melenchon , who demands a renegotiation of key treaty provisions . " Positions have hardened , " said Manuel Lafont Rapnouil of the European Council on Foreign Relations . " Melenchon was very influenced by what happened to ( Greek    party ) Syriza , " which gave in to European demands after months of crisis . Syriza , the party of Greek premier Alexis Tsipras , endorsed Melenchon , saying Syriza, the party of Greek premier Alexis Tsipras " represents hope for change for France and Europe " . Le Pen , on the other hand , " is riding the wave of Brexit " and Donald Trump ’s surprise accession to the White House , Donald Trump said . The ideological underpinnings of the two candidates’ eurosceptism are worlds apart , however .   —    ‘ Dictatorship of banks’   —    Le Pen stresses economic , monetary and territorial " sovereignty " along with a " national preference " for French citizens in the workplace and the allocation of state benefits . Melenchon vows to end the " nightmare " of an EU that submits its Melenchon to " the dictatorship of the banks " and the austerity policies they its members . But both its members a showdown with Brussels and say they its members certain to come out on top given the strength of France within the bloc . Le Pen says she Le Pen launch six months of talks aimed at withdrawing France France the    Schengen area , as well as from the euro , before calling a referendum on whether the French want to leave the EU   —    a    " Frexit " . For his Le Pen , Melenchon has a    approach summed up as " change the the EU   leave it " the EU   a Plan A by which France will renegotiate its membership the EU   and a Plan B for a unilateral Frexit . As for the single currency , a poll carried out in early March found that more than 70 percent of the French oppose quitting the eurozone . On the eve of Sunday ’s first round , Melenchon has toned down his euroscepticism Melenchon saying that he would Melenchon for France to stay in the EU and the eurozone the eurozone Pen has also adjusted her rhetoric , Le Pen more on FN staple issues such as immigration and security   —    the latter question surging to the fore after Thursday ’s jihadist killing of a policeman in the Champs Elysees . On the    side , Macron says he has " Macron at heart " wants to bolster the eurozone and is the only candidate who favours CETA , the    agreement between the EU and Canada that will provisionally come into force in a few weeks . Fillon , more protective of French sovereignty , wants a    of the balance of power between Brussels and EU members states EU    Giuliani of the Robert Schuman Foundation said both Fillon and Macron Fillon too complacent with the status quo , calling the EU planks of EU platforms " Fillon and Macron " . Candidates should talk about the EU ’s EU EU needs to revitalise its role within it , France said . France Giuliani of the Robert Schuman Foundation
