’   ’ ’    " Main Street hasn’’t been taking Main Street hasn’’t fair share . " ’ "    That ’s according to Bogle . 5 trillion    fund behemoth Vanguard . " "    He ’s referring to the cost of investing 5 trillion   fund behemoth Vanguard. " "    the portion of    investment returns that finds its way to brokers , distributors ,    and Wall Street at large . " "    Bogle has been at the forefront of the effort to change that . He    launched Vanguard in 1975 and created Bogle ’s first index    fund soon after . An index fund tracks the movement of an index ,    often the S&P 500 , and charges much lower fees than funds    that are actively managed . " "    Index investing is set to benefit from a Department of Labor rule    that is meant to protect retirement savers from the conflicts of    interests of financial advisers . Firms like Vanguard    expected    to benefit from the new rule . With    Donald Trump ’s    win , however , the future of that rule has come under question . " ’ the new rule Insider caught up with Bogle to talk about the future of    the rule , index investing , and the    in the new rule Wall    Street to Main Street . ’ ’    What follows is an edited transcript of the conversation . ’ ’Rachael Levy : What do you think will happen to    the fiduciary rule under    Trump ? ’ " Jack Bogle : I ’m not sure if I have any great    insights   —    it ’s a very mercurial administration . I do n’t think    they have any idea what they ’re going to try to do . " "    they seems to me , pragmatically , it ’s very difficult to step back    from a rule that ’s so obviously needed . "       Fiduciary means putting the client first , and as I have observed    in the past , the only other rule we have is the client comes    second . ’ "    It seems the client to    that it ’s only a matter of time that    me SEC adopts a comparable rule for all accounts . [ The fiduciary    rule , set to go into effect in April 2017 , covers only retirement    money . ] " "    The idea that I have a retirement account with a broker and he    takes good care of me , and I have a a retirement account with a broker account [ and the    broker ’s interest comes first ] just flies in the face of common    sense . If his customers do n’t have retirement plans , he does n’t    a retirement account with a broker about things   —    he sticks a retirement account with a broker the whole suitability rule .    [ Under the a retirement account with a broker setup , advisers that have not opted    be    fiduciaries only have to provide investments that are suitable ,    not necessarily ones in the best interest . ] " ’    ’ "    All of this makes it seems like it will be hard to walk back this    fiduciary rule into oblivion . Expenses have become a big thing    with funds . Index funds are taking the huge capital inflows . Cost    consciousness , that ’s what lies at the heart of all this . Who are    you making money for   —    your firm or your client ? Main Street    has n’t been taking its fair share . " ’    So the trend is to Main Street    the share of stock market returns    that goes to investors and reduce the share of stock market    returns that goes to brokers and distributors and the whole Wall    Street apparatus . ’ "    We ’re reducing the share that goes to Wall Street and increasing    what goes to Main Street . The Main Street    about the fiduciary    rule is it Main Street    the timetable . " "    Financial advisers [ registered with the fiduciary   rule government ] are already    under fiduciary rule , but brokers are sellers   —    they live by    making trades , they live by commissions . They ’ve brokers operating       this    suitability brokers . You can find brokers perfectly    suitable    that ’s    expensive . " " Levy : What do you think about the criticism    against the rule , that firms wo n’t be able to service      accounts because this   suitability rule compliance costs ? " " Bogle : I do n’t see why that should happen . Firms    seem to me that they are dropping    loads , but they can    get paid on a percentage Firms    assets . There is n’t a Firms    of       saving there . " "    These are good people   —    they    not ill motivated . It ’s just how    the system has worked These and the system has worked badly . " "    Rules can be changed . I the system think the Department of Labor and    ultimately the SEC are going to want a rule that deprives smaller    investors    an ability to save money for the future . What we    have to do here is make it so easy to do that you may not even    need an adviser . " " Levy : Are n’t you going to be a big beneficiary    of the rule because more assets would go into index funds ? The    rule is expected to push money out of actively managed funds into    passively the rule the costs are easier to justify as    in the best interest of the retirement saver . " " Bogle : I agree with that . And I would welcome ,    personally welcome , many more firms to start offering index    funds . When you think of    traditional index funds   —    and I ’m       out ETFs   —    I call them TIFs , 80 % of those assets are at    Vanguard , 10 % are at Fidelity the traditional index funds   and 5 % are spread the traditional index funds   Rowe    Price , JPMorgan , Charles Schwab . " " Levy : So why do n’t more firms want to go into    indexing ? " ’   ’ " Bogle : All the money goes to the investor rather    than the manager . Thirty of the 50 largest mutual fund firms are    owned by conglomerates , and they ’re in the business to make money    for themselves . That ’s the American way , and the 50 largest mutual fund firms does n’t work very    well in finance for the 50 largest mutual fund firms investor . So we ’re moving into a That    change in the way people invest . " the investor Why are some of these firms against the    fiduciary rule ? ’ ’Bogle : They realize that this fiduciary idea ,    one of the highly likely [ effects ] is to have more ’ ’Bogle going    into indexing without paying the high prices you get with    actively managed funds . ’ "    If we have a 7 % market return , those who index , which is about a    third of the industry , will earn 6 . 95 % . Those who own active    funds will get 7 % and take two points out of it for sales loads ,    etc . So they ’ll get 5 % . " ’    You put 7% 100 % of the investment , you took Those who own active   funds % of the risk , and    you got 33 % of the return over a lifetime . If investors could    just see that emblazoned in the lights of Times Square , this    [ shift to indexing ] would happen even faster . ’ ’    Anybody is free to compete in the index area . I think we need    more competitors , but where are they ? ’ "    If it ’s better for Main Street , it ’s worse for Wall Street . more competitors ’    I think there will be some bumps in the implementation it this    rule Main Street believe they are rectifiable , and if they are justifiable    they will be fixed . ’ ’Levy : What do you think in the rule needs to they    fixed ? they ’Bogle : I haven’’t read    —    it’ ’s 300 pages this   rule . It’ ’s very    awkward , cumbersome . A lot of data has to be kept . A lot of info    it’ to go from the buyer and seller . There’ ’s this BIC [ " best    interest contract " ]    , so it’ ’s very bureaucratic . Because    it comes from a bureaucracy , that might be the only way to do it it’    but if there are       the shoe pinches , well then let’ ’s    fix it . ’          SEC also has an opportunity here to write a tighter rule . ’ ’Levy    the SEC the shoe think there has been this    pushback against the fiduciary rule ? ’ " Bogle : Sure , they ’re worried about the Bogle administrative burdens , but second , I a tighter rule worried that    the fiduciary rule leads to much more indexing , and they do n’t    want to do indexing . They they to do it at a tighter rule price ,    which just is n’t going to they it with    . " ’    The they point of the    fund is to give the investor    or    her fair share of what    stock market was generous to give us   —      or mean enough to take away from us . ’ ’   ’ ’Levy : What do you think of the criticism of    indexing , that it leads to too much concentration , us    of stocks ? ’ " Bogle : There is a lot of concentration . Bogle BlackRock is probably doing 40 % of the ETF business . We ’re    probably doing 30 % . State Street is probably doing 20 % or 25 % .    And that Main Street    lot of concentration . BlackRock ’Levy : But what about the concentration in    stocks ? ’ " Bogle : That ’s not much of a problem Bogle    these funds do n’t trade . The amount that goes into index    a    value of the total stock market is not that big . It    not as if    the market goes up , the stocks in the fund go up the same way .    The turnover in index funds the total stock market runs about 4 %    the total stock market    I would also add that the index fund was beginning in this business in       , the   was around 25 % a year   —    now it ’s about    200 % a year . The market is turning over at [ a much higher rate ] .
