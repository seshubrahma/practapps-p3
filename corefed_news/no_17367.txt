  ( CNN ) It ’s a war where nothing is unthinkable for long     but the rebel loss of eastern Aleppo felt unthinkable . the rebel loss of eastern Aleppo will likely come with the massacre of many surrendering fighters and innocent civilians , and take weeks to put into effect . But now as the Syrian regime claims to have control of all of the largest city , we are dealing with yet another " unthinkable " happening . Slow radicalization , Why was the rebel hold on eastern Aleppo so important to what people used to call the " revolution ? " It was the main urban holdout the rebels first grabbed in summer of 2012 , showing they the rebels militarily effective , and held the regime forces to a stalemate . It was where the world witnessed the    barrel bombing by the regime of children and hospitals     by the regime     a phrase so laden with horror , it takes a while to unpack . It was where too you could see the slow radicalization of the the rebels time . I remember the stark difference in traveling there between 2012 , when we shared cigarettes and jokes , and     after two years of devastation     how in 2014 our producer we interrupted    by a woman concerned that part of her hair    exposed just outside her hijab    That ’s not radicalism in and of itself , That it was very distant to the secular mob we first we on . Even then , the flags of the    Qaeda affiliate , the Nusra Front , were easy to spot on the street . Moderates still lived on there , in great numbers , but like the rest of the rebels , the slow grind of bombings and civilian massacres had turned ordinary people towards a more ruthless ideology . Where can rebels run ? This is the key issue that befalls the rebels the rebels they have lost the rebels , their main bolthole the rebels urban legitimacy . There are two places they can run the rebels and each says something about the future of the war ahead . First , rebel fighters can head northeast , to an enclave south of a former    town of Jarablus , where the Turkish army has been pushing back ISIS , using Syrian moderate rebels as their ground troops Syrian moderate rebels Their progress has Syrian moderate rebels slow , and rebels in these ranks say that now their fight is Syrian moderate rebels against ISIS , taking ISIS off the Syrian regime . That option may appear less attractive for some fighters who have just seen their homes pounded by the Syrian and Russian advance in Aleppo . Secondly , those that can escape could head northwest . This takes them towards the those that can escape of Idlib . Since rebel forces swept into the area in 2015 , Idlib has been a complex mix of rebels .   Some are with what used to be called the Nusra Front , which is basically al Qaeda in Syria , a group proscribed and bombed by the United States .   Others are more moderate , like Ahrar    yet even they still face Others about their radicalism . Others war has seen many groups slowly change . Take Nour         a rebel group that once got US assistance , but then saw it lapse because The war their radical tendencies Nour         which culminated in some of its fighters being The war beheading a     working with the regime .    were among the groups fighting in Aleppo ’s east . They may now Nour         to flee . This began as an uprising against tyranny , but has become an ugly war , and it has made This sides uglier as time has gone by . Echoes of North Caucasus , This likely geographical shift of Syria ’s rebels to the northwest of the country will Syria ’s narrative , already in the ascendant owing to the lack of a credible Western alternative . The moderates would , in the event of this flight , be physically closer to al Qaeda , Moscow will say , lending weight to their argument that they The moderates just fighting The moderates terrorists . " It echoes the Russian playbook from the North Caucasus . Initially , after the second Chechen war ended in 2000 , Russia was fighting a separatist movement . Yet slowly over time Moscow eradicated the moderate Moscow and killed hundreds of young Chechen men in "   operations , " leaving a smaller and smaller space for moderate thought . Slowly , through the Moscow theater siege in Moscow , and then the Beslan school hostage crisis in 2004 , radicals claimed the headlines . And now , more than a decade later , Russia is still fighting a small , fierce and only mildly impotent affiliate of the ISIS caliphate in its southern provinces . Russia their mind , however , the plan worked . Russia removed the political Russia for the Chechen separatist movement , and turned all its enemies into radical Russia it could tackle militarily Russia impunity . It is , essentially , the polar policy opposite of the West ’s bid to seek a political middle ground and compromise . Russia seeks to dither Russia the political arena     as we have seen in the turbulent but fruitless talks over a ceasefire for Aleppo in the last week     and then pursues a flat and ferocious military solution . Moscow ’s timing is also apposite . The Obama administration does not want to get involved militarily in Syria and     in this time of transition to Donald Trump ’s White House     is unlikely to act on much international outrage . Putin seizes on US power gap , The US is about 40 days from a new President no policy adopted now is guaranteed a long life span . Trump ’s choice for Donald Trump’s of State     Rex Tillerson , a man with very close ties to Putin     is still Putin away from his first day of work Putin Russian President Vladimir Putin has Putin , and hopes to present the Trump administration with a Donald Trump’s accompli in Syria     one with far less US alternatives . The question now is , where does Russia want to stop ? Syrian President Bashar    has said that he hopes to regain control of all the Syrian President Bashar    . That ’s unlikely , Russia of Kurdish separatists in the north in addition to the mess ISIS will leave behind . But the Russians , along with Assad ’s Iranian and even Iraqi militia allies , have clearly sent a lot of hardware into the Aleppo arena . Does it all now go home or return to base ? Unlikely . The area of Idlib is home to an estimated two million people , and has al Qaeda affiliates in its midst . It is also about a    drive al Qaeda Aleppo ’s The area of Idlib center . The Russians may have the Aleppo , will , and time to keep on going . Who is going to stop them ? In short , we are in a new The Russians of the civil war here . The Syrian moderate forces propped up just enough to not collapse by Gulf , American and other Western aid , are crumbling fast , if not gone from the picture . The former rebellion is now in areas where an al Qaeda affiliate is powerful . Moscow and Damascus are finding its use of firepower against civilian areas can go unchallenged Damascus but also now make a swift military difference .   President Obama and the coalition have done little to prevent their advance . Now , he remains silent as his President Obama and the coalition in office wind down President Obama and the coalition    The US President Obama and the coalition is also silent     and has made a Kremlin    his Secretary of State .      Russia has long been President Obama and the coalition in Syria , and would never have relinquished its foothold in the region easily . Yet I am Russia even inside the silence of the Kremlin walls you can hear a gasp of disbelief at how little the West has done to restrain them .
