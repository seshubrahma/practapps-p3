’   ’ "    President Trump ’s tax plan   yet , but Treasury Secretary    Steven Mnuchin gave us one big clue   —    a proposed 15 % business tax    rate , a big drop from the current 35 % . " "    But ask some Kansans and you ’ll learn how that kind of tax cut    could have serious unintended consequences . " "    In 2013 , as part of the state ’s    tax cuts , Kansas    slashed Kansas business tax rate down to 0 % . It was supposed to spur    economic growth . " ’    After all , if businesses have more money in hand , businesses can ,    theoretically , hire more people and invest in making new    products . ’ ’    Instead ,   from a number of institutions say it turned more    into a " tax avoidance " program , rather than encouraging    investment . A lot of    workers like law partners ,    accountants , and doctors stopped taking salaries and instead    started claiming the profits of the business . For A lot of   workers like law partners,   accountants, and doctors , state    income tax essentially went from a maximum of 4 . 6 % to nothing .    This has led to the ongoing budget crisis . ’ ’    " Kansas has been an unmitigated budgetary disaster , " says Dr Lori    McMillan , a    professor at Washburn University told    Business Insider . " It was a very messy , blunt club when a scalpel    was needed . " ’ ’    The economic growth from the tax cuts never materialized . Kansas was saddled with an almost instantaneous budget hole , leaving       and pensions drastically underfunded . Infrastructure    repairs were put on hold . And to deal with a   drop in revenue   —    almost twice what was         —    Kansas Kansas sales Kansas , hurting all residents ,    but    lower income Kansans . ’ ’    Kansas has Kansas peculiarities , but the lessons still apply    nationally    In the state Kansas 0 % tax applies only to    " " businesses , which send their profits directly the 0% tax    the companies ’’ owners . Before this law , those owners would the companies’’ owners pay Kansas ’’ individual Kansas rate . The 2012 law effectively this law new category just for them , where they the companies’’ owners nothing . the companies’’ owners ’   ’ "    Nationally , 90 % of US companies are    according to    the   so it ’s possible Trump ’s tax cut would have    similar effects . It could    encourage some      Trump’s tax cut to become independent contractors rather than remain    companies’ employees . " ’   ’ ’   ’ "    Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback pushed hard for this tax break . He bet    it would help Sam Brownback state       . But the       budget shortfall has had drastic ripple effects . " "    It has exacerbated a    crisis the      budget shortfall The state ’s supreme    court the state’s even called the low level of funding    unconstitutional . " "    Despite widespread criticism , including from within his own party    in the legislature Brownback Brownback has mostly resisted reversing the    tax cuts . The state ’s budget director , Shawn the state’s ’s    appointed by the governor , says that might be changing . " ’    " The goal is to be " Sullivan told Business Insider .    " The governor believes the current plan is best , the governor the    legislature deals with the current situation , he is willing to    compromise . " ’ ’ the governor Sullivan also refutes    validity of some of the economic Sullivan studies of Kansas completed by the Tax Foundation and academics ,    saying , " They’’ve extrapolated conclusions not borne of    data . " ’ ’    But the state is still facing massive budget deficits   —    as much    as $ 1 . 1 billion through the middle of 2019 . Instead of changing    the tax cuts on business and personal income , the lawmakers have    raised sales taxes . ’ ’    " When    pick winners and losers in your tax policy , you only    shift the burden of funding the government to others who may be    less able to pay , " says McMillan . ’ ’    Kansas now has one of the highest sales tax rates in the nation    at 6 . 5 % the cigarette tax was recently raised by 79 cents to    $ 1 . 29 , and a new tax was put on vapor products as well , according    to the . ’ ’    Bernie Koch of the Kansas Economic Progress Council is n’t sure    how long that level of sales tax can last    ’ ’   ’ ’    " The sales tax was n’t meant to handle that load a new tax Koch .    " It ’s become the largest slice of the Bernie Koch of the Kansas Economic Progress Council for    . a new tax than    the income tax . I do n’t think the legislators ever thought ‘ can    the sales tax handle this ? ’ " ’ ’       lawmakers are now working to repeal the    tax    exemption Kansas part of a larger tax overhaul . In February , a       bill was sent to Gov. Brownback ’s    desk ; he vetoed it . ’ ’    " I am vetoing it Gov. Brownback the legislature failed to fulfill my    request that they it savings and efficiencies before asking the    people of Kansas the legislature more taxes , " the governor said . " I am    vetoing it because Kansas Gov. Brownback to keep more of their      cash . it ’ Kansas    Following the veto , the Kansas families agency Moody ’s issued a    negative outlook for the state . Even though people are changing    the way they file and are going out of their way to get the tax people cut , they ’re within the people of the law . " "    Trump people team says its plan might work differently .   " ’    Mnuchin says the Trump " will make sure that there are    rules in place so that wealthy people can’’t create      and use that as a mechanism to avoid paying the tax rate that    they should be on the personal side . "   ’ "    But the big question is , how does he do that ? What legal rules    can the administration come up with so that tax lawyers and    accountants ca n’t find legal loopholes .   " ’    " Kansas is a teaser for how hard it is to budget this kind of tax    cut , " McMillan said .   ’ ’    Details of the Trump plan are being negotiated with    Congress .   ’ "    Meanwhile , some are wondering if Kansas’ schools will open in the    fall . After the supreme court ’s   legislators must pass some form of tax reform to    properly fund the schools .   " ’    " I’’m optimistic something will get done , " Koch said . " Mostly    because if the schools close , there will be riots in the    streets . " ’ " President Trump ’s tax plan does n’t have a lot . .. " ’’ ’’ ’’
