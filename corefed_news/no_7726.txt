Following the outbreak of violence against Donald Trump supporters in San Jose yesterday , Vox editor Emmett Rensin called for    protesters to double down on protesters rioting . [ Advice : If Trump comes to your town , start a riot .   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,    Let ’s be clear : It ’s never a shame to storm the barricades set up around a fascist .   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   Despite outrage from other users on Twitter , Rensin doubled down in a bizarre    comment . Listen , if Trump is Hitler then you ’ve got no business condemning rioters . If Trump is n’t , you ’ve got no business pretending normal is better .   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   Rensin ’s point appears to be that the punditry , who have regularly compared Trump to a fascist dictator and a threat to democracy , ought to be supporting , or at least not condemning ,    violence . 1 . Spend half a year calling Trump a xenophobic fascist . 2 . Likely victims of xenophobic fascism act out . 3 . " WHAT HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN "   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   But again , the point is that you can not spend a year calling a man a unique threat to democracy then be shocked when people act that way .   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   If you too believe he ’s a fascist , then ask yourself what a fascist means to concern troll poor , Latino folks who take that belief seriously .   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   You spent a year saying Trump was a fascist , and particularly an    bigot . Hispanics take that seriously , and you ’re Shocked .   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   And listen : I do tend to agree Trump is atypically threatening . That ’s why I ’m not going to condemn rioters .   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   Rensin , who admitted to being a communist in a later tweet , responded to critics accusing ’m of inciting violence by claiming ’m was merely calling for property damage , not violence . So that ’s OK then    …      @Zack_Parker _ Property Destruction Is Not Violence ,   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   ding ding ding ding ding https :   .    —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   ’m went on to mock critics who threatened to report ’m to the authorities for inciting violence . Look like conservative twitter has decided to Indict Me for Incitement . Good luck , my friends !   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   " hello fbi""yes hello a man from twitter is trying to incite riots on the internet""my . god . "   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   a man from twitter also suggested that conservatives were just as bad . " No no that ’s different that ’s FOR America , that ’s resisting an illegal Muslim tyrant ! "   —    Emmett Rensin ( @emmettrensin ) June 3 , 2016 ,   Vox , founded by former Daily Kos editors and edited by Ezra Klein , is    for       , masked behind their its   biases objective slogan of " explain the news . " Even so , to have one of their its   biases defend the violence that occurred in San Jose yesterday is likely to deepen their its   biases for    wackiness even further .
