’   ’ ’    President Donald Trump on Thursday afternoon threw out an idea    for financing President Donald Trump wall with   to the US . ’ ’    President Donald Trump did , after all , promise that Mexico would pay for his wall while on the campaign trail . ’ ’    The problem is , if President Donald Trump puts a 20 % tariff on goods coming in from    Mexico , the US the US certainly pay for it too . the US The plan    would also violate international trade law   in the World Trade Organization , and our    trade pacts with Mexico , just to be clear . ) ’ ’    " Trump’ ’s plans to finance his wall are Trump’ to hit the auto    industry like a ton of bricks , " said Lee Branstetter , a professor    of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon . " The    consequences for American workers and American business would be    immediate . " ’ ’ fell 2 % on    this news    ’ ’’ "    Mexico ships $ 50 . 5 billion in finished cars and $ 501 billion in    car parts to the US , . Over the    past six years , US car manufacturers have invested $ 24 billion in    Mexico ’s auto Mexico . " ’    But even before that , any disruption in the flow of goods between    the US and Mexico was enough Mexico bring Detroit to its knees . Detroit ’    The Peterson Institute of International Economics put a solid    example of this in a recent report : ’ ’    Now , because trade treaties also affect tax policy , changing it    is not 100 % clearly up to the executive branch of the government .    But Trump    argue the tariff is necessary in the face of a    national emergency . It would take a minute before his claim was Trump ultimately challenged in court . ’ ’    " Conceivably a President Trump Trump officials to    investigate Trump national security implications for the US    industrial heartland resulting from thousands of Chinese and    Mexican imports , " the Peterson Institute said in its report .    " the Peterson Institute exception ,    courts defer to executive branch    determinations of national security . Hence , following such an    investigation , it is conceivable that President Trump could    impose high tariffs on wide swaths of imported merchandise . " ’ ’    Naturally , that would mean higher prices . But perhaps that is    worth it to some Americans who are concerned about illegal    immigration and drug trafficking    ’ ’   ’ ’   ’
