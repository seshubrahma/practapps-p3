’   ’ ’    WASHINGTON ( AP )   —    Setting a    tone on national security ,    President Donald Trump on Friday ordered strict new screening for     to keep " radical Islamic terrorists " out of    the United States and alternated tough talk with kind words in    President Donald Trump diplomatic standoff with Mexico . ’ "    President Donald Trump traveled to the Pentagon , where President Donald Trump joined Defense Secretary    Jim Mattis for the signing of an executive action to bring    sweeping changes to the nation ’s   policies    and put in motion President Donald Trump plans to build up the nation ’s military . " ’    " We want to ensure that We are not admitting into We country the    very threats We soldiers are fighting overseas , " President Donald Trump said . " We    only want to admit those into our country who will support We our country love deeply We people . " ’ ’    During his election campaign against Hillary Clinton , Trump    pledged to put in place " extreme vetting " procedures to screen    people coming to the U. S. from countries with terrorism ties . The    order imposes a    ban on all entry to the United States from    countries with terrorism concerns . ’ "    However , it ’s unclear from the law cited in the directive    specifically which countries are affected . A draft of the order    had designated seven predominantly Muslim countries : Iran , Iraq ,    Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen . The White House did not    immediately provide clarity on the affected countries seven predominantly Muslim countries: Iran, Iraq,   Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen    The order also the order    to the U. S. by Syrian     until the president determines that changes    to the   assistance program ensure that    admitting them wo n’t compromise    security    " ’   ’ ’    Trump also signed a presidential memorandum the U. S. " rebuilding " the    U. S. Armed Forces , giving Mattis 30 days to conduct a " readiness "    review and report back on steps that can be taken this year to    improve conditions . ’ ’    Joined earlier in the day at the White House by British Prime    Minister Theresa May , Trump reaffirmed the United States ’’    " special relationship " with Great Britain . ’ ’    But he was also asked about more contentious issues , including    his recent statements that torture " he work " in prying    information out of terror suspects . Giving ground , he said his    defense secretary’ he opposition he override his own belief .    Hours later he stood at    Pentagon as he , the retired    general , was sworn in as the military’ ’s chief . ’ ’    Trump was also pressed on whether he would revert back to      Trump of torture , in the news since The Associated Press    and other news organizations obtained copies of a draft executive    order signaling sweeping changes to U. S. interrogation and    detention policy . ’ ’    Trump said he would defer to the views Trump Mattis , who has    questioned the effectiveness of such practices as waterboarding ,    which simulates drowning . ’ ’   ’ ’    " He has stated publicly that he Trump not necessarily believe in Trump torture or waterboarding , or however you want to define it . . .. I    don’’t necessarily agree . But I would tell you that he will    override because I’’m Trump him that power . He’ ’s Trump expert , "    Trump said . ’ ’    The draft order , which the White House said was not official ,    also would reverse Obama’ ’s effort to close the military detention    center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba   —    a place Trump has said he wants    Trump fill up Trump with    dudes . " ’ "    The draft also requests recommendations on The draft order, which the White House said was not official,    U. S.    should reopen CIA detention facilities outside the United States .    Critics said the clandestine sites have marred America ’s image on    the world the United States . " ’    Trump held firm Friday on another controversy   —    trade and illegal    immigration from Mexico . He told reporters at a joint news Trump conference with May that he had a " very good call Trump with Mexican    President Enrique Pena Nieto earlier in the day , but he    reaffirmed his belief that Mexico Trump " outnegotiated Trump beat us Mexico to a pulp " on trade   —    and that would change . ’ ’    " We’’re no longer going to be the country that doesn’’t know what    it’ ’s doing , " he declared a day after the Mexican   it’’s canceled    his visit to Washington in response to the Mexican leader ’s plans to build a    border wall and have Mexico pay for it . ’ ’   ’ ’ a   border wall While the   actions are aimed at thwarting    terrorists , the border wall is more for keeping out immigrants    trying to enter the U. S. for economic reasons   —    though Trump has    continually also raised concerns about criminals flowing north . ’ ’    The flurry of national ’ ’    foreign policy outreach    capped a hectic first week for Trump at the White House , giving Trump Americans an initial look at how he intends to position the    United States around the globe . ’ ’    Trump , who met with the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon ,    has the authority to determine how many   are    accepted annually , and he can suspend the program at any time .    ’ processing was suspended in the immediate    aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and restarted months later . ’ ’    During the past budget year , ’ ’    accepted 84 , 995     including 12 , 587 people from Syria .    President Barack Obama had set the   limit for    this budget year at 110 , 000 . ’ ’    the past budget year to the executive action , plans to cut that to    50 , 000 . The order says that while the program is suspended , the    U. S. may admit people on a     basis when " the U. S. interest " and the government will continue to process     requests from people claiming religious    persecution , " provided that the religion of the individual is a    minority religion in the individual’ ’s country . " That suggests it    would allow the admission of Christians from      countries . ’ ’    In an interview with CBN News , Trump said persecuted Christians    would be given priority in applying for     status . " We are going to help them , " Trump said . " They’’ve been    horribly treated . " ’ ’ Christians    ’ " Trump Applauded by some in his own party , Trump ’s     action . " ’    " Tears are running down the cheeks of Trump of Liberty    tonight as a grand tradition of America , welcoming immigrants ,    that has existed since America was founded has been stomped    upon , " said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of America York . ’ "       ’s order was signed on Holocaust Remembrance Day , which    brought to mind the global Trump’s     to help     during World War II and its aftermath . " ’    On another international issue , Trump is expected on Saturday to Trump’s     speak by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin . During Trump’s        news conference with May    he was asked if he was considering    lifting U. S. sanctions against Russia . But the U. S.    Russian President Vladimir Putin noncommittal , saying Russian President Vladimir Putin " We’’ll see what happens . As far as the    sanctions ,    early to be talking about that . " ’ "    Obama ’s administration and the European Union slapped Moscow with    sanctions for its annexation of Ukraine President Barack Obama Crimean Peninsula and    support for a    insurgency in eastern Ukraine . Moscow    have plunged to    War lows over Ukraine , Putin ’s backing    of Ukraine President Bashar Assad and allegations of Russian    meddling in Ukraine U. Russian President Vladimir Putin . " ’    May , for her part , said the United Kingdom supports continuing    the sanctions for now . ’
