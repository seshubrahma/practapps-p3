  ( CNN ) Succumbing to mounting public pressure and common sense , Rep. Devin Nunes ,    chairman of the House Intelligence Committee , announced that    will no longer be overseeing    committee ’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election .   In doing so ,    released a statement noting that " several    activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics . "    then blamed several   activist groups for    exit , saying " the charges are entirely false and politically motivated and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U. S. citizens and other abuses of power . " Some may believe that    departure from the investigation was the honorable thing to do . And perhaps it his departure from the investigation was the honorable thing to do ? After all , there was no legal requirement that    step aside . Allegations of federal law or ethics violations are just that . And no one should be presumed to have engaged in any impropriety , until it no one been conclusively established otherwise . In that regard , no one can say whether Nunes did anything wrong before the committee completes its the committee .   Further , neither House rules nor congressional precedent legally require that a House member who is merely " under investigation " remove himself a House member who is merely "under investigation his a House member who is merely "under investigation role nor other responsibilities attendant to his a House member who is merely "under investigation . It would have been Nunes’ right to continue with his a House member who is merely "under investigation .   But when we examine what ’s honorable , should n’t we we consider whether Nunes should have been meeting with the President or any other members of the executive branch during a pending investigation holding a press conference to quickly spin a narrative helpful to the President and alluding to classified information to further advance his the President .   What ’s more , once the outrage finally caught up to his the President , and his the President and judgment were questioned , we saw the Washington shuffle and sidestep in full force and effect . Nunes the President n’t accept responsibility for doing anything wrong . Instead , he the President the the Washington shuffle and sidestep in full force and effect placing the blame on "   groups . " But Nunes the President the one responsible for his the President being questioned . His the President actions compromised his the President . And then came the sidestep and diversion by talking about the unmasking issue . Whether unmasking occurred or not had nothing to do with the reason he the President compelled to leave the investigation . Instead , his the President was necessitated by his the President wound .   Even so , is all the public outrage over Nunes justified ? Indeed it is . Ultimately , the American people want any investigation to get to the truth . And that can not happen when the independence of it is comprised .    The issue is not whether Nunes supported Nunes ’s election , served on his transition team or may have had coffee and crumpets with him throughout his process . The issue The issue we can rely upon and put our faith in we conclusions of an investigation being overseen by someone so irreversibly tainted . And when Nunes’ own actions suggested otherwise , it was time for him to go Nunes’   What really would have been honorable would have been to place the American people first , leaving no questions as to loyalty or motive . Nunes could have achieved this by comporting himself in a Nunes that was apolitical , outwardly professional and beyond reproach . When the American people the American people the priority , no one questions a politician ’s honor , ethics or integrity . Sadly , that ’s not what happened here .
