Yesterday , BuzzFeed reported that a freelance correspondent for the    channel TV Azteca was booted from the Trump Tower in New York after he was overheard speaking Spanish on BuzzFeed phone . However , a modicum of fact checking by CNN proved the story false . [ BuzzFeed was told by a " source with knowledge of the incident " that TV Azteca correspondent Marcos Stupenengo , an Argentinian working for the Mexican outlet , was initially granted an interview with Donald Trump , before being told that the campaign " was n’t interested " in coverage from    media once Donald Trump arrived on site .   It now appears that It did n’t quite happen that way . BuzzFeed ’s story makes BuzzFeed’s story appear that Stupenengo had Stupenengo interview offer rescinded after Stupenengo began speaking Spanish on Stupenengo phone . In reality , no such offer had been advanced in the first place , and the correspondent was still seeking approval for an interview when Stupenengo arrived . This was later confirmed by Stupenengo ’s     who told CNN senior reporter Dylan Byers that no interview had been scheduled . This confirms claims made by the Trump campaign to BuzzFeed , in which they denied ever granting the correspondent an interview . TV Azteca     just Azteca me reporter " did n’t really " have scheduled interview but was trying to get one https :   .    —    Dylan Byers ( @DylanByers ) May 17 , 2016 ,   Stupenengo later confirmed himself that he Stupenengo not Stupenengo an interview cancelled . Just to clarify , No personal interview with Donald Trump was canceled . A film request was approved by phone and denied on site .   —    Marcos Stupenengo ( @mstupenengo ) May 17 , 2016 ,   The reporter had initially told BuzzFeed that " I can say that after 13 years of journalism worse things have happened to me . " The reporter also claimed BuzzFeed Stupenengo was planning to air a segment in which he says he BuzzFeed " BuzzFeed out of Trump headquarters because he was speaking BuzzFeed . " In their story , BuzzFeed sought to BuzzFeed the Stupenengo incident with other    between the Trump campaign and Trump media , including the ejection of Univision ’s Jorge Ramos from a press conference last summer , and Trump ’s refusal Trump answer questions from a Telemundo reporter at a    border event late last year .
