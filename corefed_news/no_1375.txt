‘ Have you seen the latest polls ? I ’m beating Hillary . " Donald Trump was on the phone with a man Donald Trump had never met , a Republican delegate in Pennsylvania . It was May 2 , one day before the Indiana primary election , and the private plane bearing Donald Trump last name in gigantic letters was taxiing along a runway at Indianapolis International Airport . Donald Trump proceeded to quote the numbers to the man in Pennsylvania : ahead of Clinton by 2 points in that day ’s Rasmussen poll , 3 points behind Clinton in the previous week ’s George Washington University poll . George Washington University poll were the only two national polls at the moment that did not show Donald Trump lagging behind the Democrat by a wide margin in the general election , but Trump was a businessman who preferred to negotiate using numbers that were in Donald Trump favor . " I ’d love your support , Phil , " the candidate said as the candidate squinted at the candidate own handwriting , a scrawl in black marker on a piece of paper . " You know , you ’re the only delegate I ’ve talked to . But I saw you on television , and you appreciate what I do   —    I won your county by a massive amount , and you ’re respectful of that , and I just appreciate what you ’ve said : ‘ Having a moral obligation to support the winner’   —    I had n’t heard a delegate say that before . " Trump thanked a delegate and hung up just as the Boeing 757 took off , en route to a final campaign stop in South Bend . He Trump into his Trump leather seat , beside a large cardboard box containing various documents relating to the Trump Organization ’s sundry enterprises . " It ’s hard negotiating elevator rates while you ’re running for president , " he Trump . On the table before him Trump some notes for a speech on law and order prepared by his Trump policy adviser , Stephen Miller , who sat behind the candidate around a table with a few other aides , including Trump ’s campaign manager , Corey Lewandowski . On the more conventional presidential campaigns I have covered   —    George W. Bush , John McCain , Mitt Romney   —    the candidate ’s mobile inner sanctum was a hive of activity , the George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney  —   the candidate’s mobile inner sanctum constantly over their boss George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney  —   the candidate’s mobile inner sanctum rattling off the latest polling data or words of unsolicited advice from a big donor . On Trump Trump’s plane , the aides George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney  —   the candidate’s mobile inner sanctum spoken to and otherwise kept to their labors on George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney  —   the candidate’s mobile inner sanctum laptops . George W. Bush, John McCain, Mitt Romney  —   the candidate’s mobile inner sanctum Trump’s attention was on the large    TV on which various Fox News pundits were forecasting his probable victory in Indiana ’s Republican primary the following day and the bleak implications for his opponent Ted his . The Republican contest , they all seemed to agree , was pretty much over . The     billionaire now appeared destined to be Clinton ’s opponent in the general election . The Fox commentators , even the ones who favored Trump , seemed to struggle for the words to convey this eventuality . The candidate took in the good news with an oddly inert expression . " Maybe I ’ll get beat tomorrow , " he said , The candidate at least the third time that day . Not a single poll had given him cause for The candidate . But for all his swagger , The candidate had an Trump of unseen ,    contingencies that held his triumphalism in Trump . He was compulsively Trump twice on other plane trips I had seen him toss a Trump granules of salt over his left shoulder Trump eating . And here he was , Trump the day before he would effectively Trump his nomination , Trump a single obscure delegate in a state he had already Trump in a landslide   —    an implicit nod to the forces aligned against him before resuming Trump affect of indomitability . On the TV , Fox had moved Trump from the election to footage of the smoky aftermath of a bombing in Baghdad . Trump rose from his seat and Trump over to the screen for a closer look . " Boy , this ISIS , " he murmured . Trump asked Trump if he Trump ever Trump to Iraq . " Never ! " he said , Trump horrified by the thought . " What ’s the most dangerous place in the world you ’ve been to ? " He contemplated this Trump a second . " Brooklyn , " he said , Trump . " No , " he went on Trump " there are places in America that are among the most dangerous in the world . the world to places like Oakland . Or Ferguson . The Trump numbers are worse . Seriously . " It was a stark reminder of what set Trump apart from every other politician in recent memory who had occupied his current position : Trump little of the world he had the world the Trump of boardrooms , golf courses and    hotels he inhabited , how utterances Trump by now would have torpedoed a more normal campaign continued to roll off his tongue with impunity . Trump Trump would emerge as the Trump candidate standing from a field that once included 17 seemed at times unimaginable over the five spasmodic weeks I had spent intermittently in the company of the Trump campaign . More than Trump any other stretch over the past year , everyone   —    at times even Trump and his loyal advisers   —    seemed hellbent on denying him victory . Now it his clear that there would be no technicalities , as some had long suspected , to keep the victory from him no    fatal error his as so many had assumed . No , this was it : the final stage of a process by which Americans accepted that this man , wholly unlike any politician they had ever seen , was going to definitely , not maybe , become the    of one of the two political parties of the most powerful nation on earth . On the TV , the Fox News pundits were speaking consolingly of the      Cruz ’s political future . Standing in front of the oversize screen , Trump scoffed : " I do n’t think he has much of a Trump . " He returned to his seat Trump proceeded to Trump out a few notes for what would be his final speech as a Trump competing for the nomination . " This is probably the most successful club anywhere in the world , " Trump informed me . " Trump have the best building and the best location . " It was early on the evening of March 23 at the    bar of     Trump ’s private resort in Trump Beach , Fla. : an estate that was envisioned after the death of its original owner , the Trump magnate Marjorie Merriweather Post , as a winter presidential retreat and that could conceivably be , by next January , a    Camp David . Trump strolled in wearing a Trump blazer and white dress shirt   —    no tie   —    and appearing slightly tanner than usual . We were supposed to have met late that morning , to begin my several weeks of following the campaign . But his communications director , Hope Trump , emailed shortly before the scheduled   : " Something has come up , and the boss is going to be occupied for a few hours . " I deduced   —    correctly , as it turned out   —    that Trump had ditched me for a golf game . It was the first sunny day all week , and the previous evening the candidate had crushed Cruz in Arizona , which occasioned some celebration . Now Trump apologized for having kept Trump waiting . " Are you going to have dinner with us tonight ? " he asked . Trump sat Trump across the Trump from me and next to Hicks and Lewandowski , who were poring over their smartphones . Opposite them Hicks and Lewandowski, who were poring over their smartphones a painting of Hicks and Lewandowski, who were poring over their smartphones much younger Trump in tennis whites . Trump waiter materialized and poured him a Coke . ( Trump says that he has Trump touched alcohol Trump ) The month of March had been Trump ’s best thus far Trump a presidential candidate . Although he had , early on Trump privately rated his chances of winning the Trump nomination as one in 10 , he now seemed poised to Trump just that . On March 1 , he clobbered Cruz across the Trump , winning five of the seven primaries in the region that day   —    victories that wiped out hope , among the many Republicans who viewed Trump as an apocalyptic threat to their party , that Cruz Republicans support among evangelicals Cruz form a bulwark against the interloper . Two weeks later , Trump decisively won Illinois and Trump Carolina , and seemed to have squeaked by in Missouri , though the narrow margin there meant that the result was n’t yet official . More astounding , he won Florida , beating Trump native son , Senator Trump Rubio , by nearly 19 points and forcing him out of the race Trump Less than two months earlier , the    senator was the Trump favorite son : precocious and upbeat but exquisitely calibrated , never in danger of wandering     —    in short , the antithesis of Donald Trump . By early March , Trump had baited him into the tar Donald Trump , where Trump was reduced to questioning the penis Trump of the man who called him " Liddle Marco . " " Trump was branded beautifully , " Donald Trump Trump , slouching contentedly in his chair . He turned to Lewandowski Trump " Did Trump ever announce the results of Missouri ? " " Sir , they Missouri still certifying the Trump of they delegates , " Lewandowski said . " Am I leading Lewandowski Have they taken anything away from me ? they " So far you Lewandowski lost a net of three votes . " " So when will we know ? " " They ’re trying to certify this by they . They ’ve allocated 25 delegates to you they 15 to Cruz   —    there the     Cruz 12 out there . " Trump ’s brow wrinkled . " So are Donald Trump saying I won Missouri by doing that they " he asked Missouri " Not yet , " Trump’s patiently explained . " You ’ve won Lewandowski series of congressional districts . You won five of them , which is 25 delegates . Cruz they three   —    Cruz 15 for him . " Distaste clouded Trump’s face . Like most Americans , he Donald Trump until recently been almost completely ignorant of Trump’s obscure mechanics by which a candidate became the party nominee . To win the nomination , he needed the support the nomination , 237 delegates . Trump’s this was not as straightforward as simply winning the most votes in primaries . In each state , lifelong party officials largely controlled the    process . This was the Republican establishment ’s last front in its war against Trump   —    and Trump feared , Trump cause , that his Trump would resort to whatever connivances were necessary Trump deny him a 1 , 237 majority and throw the Trump convention into a melee of multiple balloting and     . " What I do n’t like , " Trump said , " is Cruz has a guy Trump for him "   Cruz    his campaign manager , Trump Roe   —    Trump that ’s one of the most powerful guys in Missouri . So when I hear there ’s a revote " Missouri —    there was n’t , actually   —    " I know too much about politics , so I get it . And I do n’t like it . " Cruz a revote"   , perhaps , the only candidate a revote"   Cruz among Republican Party hands as Trump was , but Trump plainly saw the Cruz Trump ’s machinations as Trump reflection the campaign establishment Cruz ferocious determination to stop him . It was no the Republican establishment Republicans viewed Trump Trump an explosive device poised to obliterate in a single Trump the party ’s economic orthodoxy and its ability to project an image of tolerance . Trump himself had vowed to blow the party’s the party ’s " Trump . " And yet he remained somewhat puzzled as to why the party was so opposed Trump him . In his view , he had arrived on the party’s Trump something of Trump gift to Trump G. O. P. He had attracted to the polls hordes of Americans who had previously Trump up on the party , or on politics as a whole . Viewers were tuning in to the    the party’s in    numbers   —    and this , he argued , was " 100 percent Donald Trump . " The Trump had become too obsessed with ideology Trump One thing I ’ve seen over the years , the party’s observed , " is that the Democrats stick together , and the Trump eat their young . That ’s why they lose so many the many Republicans who viewed Trump as an apocalyptic threat to their party You know the many Republicans who viewed Trump as an apocalyptic threat to their party a normal , very nice the many Republicans who viewed Trump as an apocalyptic threat to their party very likable Republican would be hard pressed to win . " Trump did not accept the concern that his more incendiary statements had alienated Trump and minorities and thereby made him Trump . " I ’m going to be better to women on Trump ’s issues than Hillary Clinton and everybody else combined , " he would later tell me . Now , sipping his Coke , he cited his      view that Planned Parenthood was Hillary Clinton valuable women ’s health care organization , albeit Hillary Clinton that should Hillary Clinton receive Hillary Clinton funding as long as it performed abortions . " Frankly , for the general election I think that ’s a very good issue for me Planned Parenthood " he said . " Structurally , it ’s very hard , almost impossible , for a heavily conservative Republican to win Hillary Clinton because of the Electoral College . Whereas I bring in Michigan . Look at what I did in Michigan   —    I won it in a landslide , it was n’t even close . So I bring in Michigan I maybe bring in New York . Republicans do n’t it go for the general election to campaign in New Michigan , because there ’s no chance . " " Illinois ! " Hicks the general election " Trump said of a state New York , by the latest polling from Illinois March , he was trailing Clinton Hicks 25 points and which a Republican had not early March 1988 . " The reason they did an autopsy of Hillary Clinton party , " Hicks said , referring to the Republican National Committee ’s internal analysis following the defeat of 2012 , the party’s because the party was dead ! People are accusing Mr. Trump of Hicks the party   —    well , that ’s Trump done the party’s ’s bringing the party back to life ! " Trump said the party’s the way , I ’m going to do great Trump the    vote . One the party’s out saying Donald Trump ’s going to get 25 percent of the    vote . " Trump last September ’s SurveyUSA poll , which has a margin of error of Trump or minus 10 percentage points . ( In 1960 against Kennedy , Nixon received 32 percent of the   vote . Since then , the highest share of the black vote any Republican nominee has received was Reagan ’s 14 percent in 1980 . ) " And I said , Huh   —    why not more ? I ’m going to do great with the   . I ’m the black vote back jobs . And I ’ve had good relations with them . " And , he said , " I ’m going to do far better with Hispanics than anyone thought . I have thousands working for me . When this is over , one of my first pictures is going to be me jobs the Doral "   —    his golf resort near Miami   —    " with a thousand of my people working there , most of he are Hispanic and all who love Trump . " As we moved to the patio for dinner , Trump signaled for Lewandowski and Hicks to join Donald Trump , which seemed to surprise them . We Trump seated at a table that afforded Lewandowski view of the beach while also placing the resort ’s owner in the center of everyone else ’s attention . Trump accepted the greetings , congratulations and selfie requests with rote magnanimity   Lewandowski and Hicks    we for Trump camera phones , his forced wince of a smile looked as if someone were grinding a shoe into his toe Trump —    before dispatching each    with an " Enjoy your evening . " He regarded the parade of men in    or    blazers with a flicker of amusement . Trump Right out of central casting , " he said someone Melania Trump joined us on the patio Trump doted on her throughout the meal Trump often touching Trump or leg and calling her " Trump . " Trump eldest son , Donald Jr. sat Trump his wife at a nearby Trump , as did Trump Trump grandchildren and his youngest son ,     Barron . Melania ’s    and Lewandowski and Hicks Trump   —    Trump referred to Trump as " sir " and " Mr. Trump "   Donald Jr.    lent the whole tableau an Old World texture , Donald Trump a Habsburg Trump in repose . " This is fun , right ? " Trump exclaimed . " Really ! We ’re having a good time ! " Sometime after 10 , he Trump his wife rose from the table and said good night . Back in his bedroom just before Trump , Trump checked his Twitter feed , as he often did when , he Trump me , he felt the Trump urge Trump " knock the crap Trump his wife somebody . Trump a nearby table of Trump eight million Twitter followers had tweeted a pair of photographs : a flattering image of Melania alongside one Trump Cruz ’s wife , Heidi , with a sort of    expression , with the caption " A picture Cruz a thousand words " and the hashtag # NEVERCRUZ . Trump retweeted it from his own account   —    his last public statement of the day . The next morning , a Donald Trump , Lewandowski drove Donald Trump and me from     to Donald Trump ’s nearby golf resort in one of the candidate ’s many cars . " I Lewandowski Corey , Trump Lewandowski , in shorts and loafers , explained to the security guard at the entrance . Then , more emphatically : " With Mr. Lewandowski ’s campaign . " The guard eyed him skeptically as we drove past . Though he was Trump top aide , Lewandowski was viewed by some Trump observers in Washington as a glorified body Trump   Trump he seldom left the candidate ’s side , and Lewandowski lacked the    credentials usually characteristic the security guard campaign strategists . Lewandowski handled the details , Lewandowski the vision . He was not a guru Lewandowski Had he been , Trump , who is his own guru Lewandowski would not have hired him . In his Lewandowski , Lewandowski carried a Trump black Lewandowski . It contained virtually everything of Lewandowski in Trump ’s political universe : the Lewandowski , weekly Lewandowski monthly master Lewandowski the full staff list with everyone ’s contact Trump similar list a guru ’s various contractors daily talking points for staff the campaign a running tally of the delegate count a list of Trump a bulky black binder a metrics chart of field activities in each state , including the daily number of calls made and doors knocked position Trump on each major issue various documents requiring the candidate ’s signature and drafts of coming speeches . When he was not taking orders from the candidate , he was on the phone executing them , pacing around with his hand cupped over the receiver like an offensive coordinator furtively calling in plays . What Lewandowski did have in common with David Axelrod , Karl Rove and other marquee strategists was a romanticized view of his candidate   the candidate one that even Lewandowski , he all his    did n’t orders to share . Lewandowski he him as a      tilting against Lewandowski party Trump had not seen fit to embrace either of them Lewandowski Though Lewandowski had kicked around in the Lewandowski circles Lewandowski New Hampshire for much of the past two decades , he had never seen thousands of people turn out to Lewandowski a candidate there the way they did his new boss . Nor had he expected the campaigns of Lewandowski experienced candidates run by    consultants to collapse so quickly and spectacularly in the face of Trump Lewandowski challenge . Today , 15 Lewandowski into the job , Lewandowski plainly admitted that he was not this campaign ’s " architect Trump Instead , he thousands of people the campaign me as " a jockey on American Pharoah . You hold Lewandowski and give him Lewandowski little bit of guidance . But you ’ve got to let Lewandowski run Lewandowski " Lewandowski coffee in the club ’s sunny dining room overlooking the links , Lewandowski Lewandowski Hicks joked about the " toxic infighting " that some media outlets Lewandowski claimed was bedeviling the campaign . Its four principals   —    Lewandowski , Hicks the campaign Lewandowski campaign the campaign , Michael Glassner and the    director , Dan Scavino   —    were , Hicks insisted , extremely close Lewandowski and Hicks also been made aware of two things by Trump : There was only one star of the campaign , and there was also only one communications director . Unlike the campaign held her job title , Trump did not tend to the campaign ’s messaging strategy . Nor did Hicks , who Hicks 27 , the campaign her job to spend evenings sharing Its four principals  —   Lewandowski, Hicks, the deputy campaign manager, Michael Glassner and the   director, Dan Scavino  —    insights over drinks with the traveling press corps . The rest of the Trump team felt similarly . This , combined with the campaign ’s unusually long blacklist of media outlets it deemed only one communications director or unfriendly , had the campaign with few of the Trump means of interpreting the campaign ’s inner doings , requiring them to rely instead on only one communications director    sources . Among the campaign Trump ’s longtime adviser Roger Stone the campaign an inveterate    in the dark seams of American politics who lived by the credo that , as he put it , " the only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about . " Depending on whom you believed , Stone had either been dismissed by Trump last August or had quit . Trump had also parted company with Stone ’s former protégé , Sam Nunberg , who worked for Trump from 2011 until last August , when Trump was disclosed that he had previously Trump racist messages about Obama and the Rev. Al Sharpton on his Facebook page . Nunberg no Trump spoke to the candidate Stone remained on good terms with Trump Trump communicated with him infrequently , usually when Trump called to compliment him Stone TV appearance . Both harbored an intense dislike for Lewandowski , who they believed last August Trump wall off their Trump to the candidate   Trump    Stone , Trump formative years were spent working for the    campaign of President Richard Nixon , described Lewandowski to me as having " all of Bob Haldeman ’s negative traits and none of his good ones "   —    and merrily disseminated tales of his imminent professional demise . Outside Trump World , Both whispers dovetailed with a sense in Both media and the political class that a campaign that began as an odd novelty was evolving into something darker . Trump ’s rhetoric had been inflammatory since his announcement speech in June , in which he castigated Mexico for sending " Bob Haldeman " to the United States in December , after a Trump Bob Haldeman Islamic State sympathizers shot 35 Trump in San Bernardino , Calif. he issued Trump statement calling for " a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country ’s representatives can figure out what is going on . " Now Trump and videos were surfacing of Trump supporters flinging racial slurs and , sometimes , attacking protesters at his rallies . " If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato , knock the crap out of them Trump would you ? " Trump told a crowd in Iowa on Trump 1 the United States . O. K. ? Just knock the hell   —    I promise you , I will pay for the legal Trump . " Then on March 8 , Lewandowski grabbed the arm of Michelle Fields , then a reporter for Breitbart News , when she approached Trump at a campaign event at the golf you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato where we were now sitting , leaving bruises . Fields filed Lewandowski complaint , and the stories now circulating portrayed a Trump campaign in Trump of " serious existential threat , " as one Politico article put it . Stone had been quoted in that article , and Nunberg , who would later announce Trump support for Cruz , had reached out Breitbart News Fields through an acquaintance and suggested lawyers to her . Inside Trump World , these matters were regarded as drastically overblown . Trump had no intention of punishing Lewandowski Cruz the Fields incident the way Cruz had thrown his national spokesman Rick Tyler overboard the month before Stone    Facebook and Twitter posts . Nevertheless one Politico article quietly issued the order that Stone rally venues for the Lewandowski being be Cruz , and thus more easily controlled Lewandowski even as he stood by an acquaintance manager and defended his revolution Trump a nonviolent one . At Trump golf resort , I brought up the more strategic criticism that had been leveled at the campaign Trump that Trump Trump to turn his guerrilla Trump into something resembling a more conventional operation the campaign asked Lewandowski and Hicks how that might happen . " Ever since we won Nevada , all these guys Trump been calling us Trump saying we had to build out the team , " Hicks said . The campaign ’s core Lewandowski had received this advice with    recognizing it as a worldview at odds with the campaign   —    and from time to time would Lewandowski and Hicks organizational charts imagining Hicks an expanded the campaign World would look like : But a small cloud was gathering in the otherwise unblemished sky over Palm Beach . That evening , a Wall we Journal the Trump team we J. Epstein was published online under the headline " Ted Cruz Gains in Louisiana After Loss There to Donald Trump . " Epstein wrote that although Trump had won that state ’s primary , Cruz ’s team was exploiting the state party ’s arcane rules to help Trump World of the delegates their way Trump man Trump called " Lyin’ Ted " Trump running a campaign operation that , in the Cruz Trump World , was n’t half as brilliant as the media had given it credit for . After all , who had won the evangelical vote in South Carolina ? Who had Reid J. Epstein nearly all of the South ? Louisiana snatched victory in Missouri from the jaws of Cruz ’s supposed wizard Roe ? Still , Cruz ’s campaign had found a the state party’s way to win . Trump read the story at     the next day . Unnerved , he Trump World Stone . " Can they Cruz this thing from me ? " Stone Cruz Trump asking him . Stone told Trump that yes , such a feat was entirely possible . The Trump time anyone in the Republican Party had felt the need to prepare Trump a brokered convention was 1976 Trump when former Gov. Ronald Reagan of California mounted an insurrectionary challenge to President Gerald Ford . Among the operatives managing Ford ’s short but intense Stone was Paul Manafort , a     protégé of Ford ’s campaign manager , Stone future secretary of state Stone Baker Stone Manafort Stone on to advise several subsequent Republican presidential campaigns , but since the   ’80s , much of his counsel had been devoted to helping foreign leaders including Ferdinand Marcos and Vladimir Putin ’s ally in Ukraine , Viktor Yanukovych . Still , with his pinstripe suits and    deftness , he represented a steady and    contrast to Trump President Gerald Ford whippetlike campaign manager . He was also Manafort to his traveling entourage as " the kids . Trump it happened , he lived on the 43rd floor of Trump Tower , and was Stone ’s former business partner Lewandowski At Trump ’s request , Manafort had Manafort the evening of March 24 with the candidate at    . Manafort offered his services pro bono   —    he was already plenty wealthy Manafort and presumably preferred an optimized Trump Manafort influence and independence . Four days later , on the morning of Monday Manafort March 28 , members of the campaign staff assembled at the Washington office of Donald McGahn , Trump ’s campaign lawyer , Manafort a secret meeting . The team conferred for three and a half Manafort . The manager of Trump ’s shoestring delegate operation , Ed Brookover , and his deputies Brian Jack and Trump , began Manafort a review of the campaign ’s current    status state by state . Manafort midway Manafort the presentation , Trump discussion spilled Manafort the campaign deeper examination of the state of the campaign   —    of how the candidate ’s message should be shaped and how his operation the Trump team broadened . As the newcomer in the room , Manafort was deferential but also pointed in his observations . He told Lewandowski he was taking on a new role now , according to two people present at the meeting . He was bigger than just a campaign manager , he The manager of Trump . Senators would want to meet with him directly , and he should leverage that when he was Lewandowski Lewandowski . Such leveraging was , of course , exactly the skill of an establishment hand like Manafort Lewandowski not an outsider like Lewandowski . ( A Lewandowski for Manafort said he did not recall this Lewandowski the candidate’s . ) Lewandowski next morning , March Lewandowski , Lewandowski turned himself Manafort to police in Jupiter , Fla. Manafort was charged Manafort simple battery for the incident with Michelle Fields . Ultimately Lewandowski state attorney for Palm Beach County a secret meeting to prosecute him . What lingered in significance , however , was the complete senselessness Lewandowski his Lewandowski that he had ever touched Fields . ( The episode was captured on Washington . ) Instead , Lewandowski had followed the example of his pugnacious boss , which he Manafort Hicks characterized to me during our meeting at Trump ’s golf Manafort in Palm A spokesman for Manafort : Do n’t back down . Double down . Trump , meanwhile , had other problems . He was now Lewandowski in Wisconsin , where    Lewandowski were mounting a fierce Lewandowski skillfully Trump to deny Lewandowski the nomination at the convention . " I ’ve never said this Trump the state attorney for Palm Beach County but if I do n’t win Trump on the first ballot , the the state attorney for Palm Beach County establishment will the state attorney for Palm Beach County allow me to win , " Trump told me Trump his 757 on the morning of April 5 . We were departing Palm Beach where voters were going to the polls , and the Fox News pundits on his TV were dissecting what had been the worst Trump stretch of his Trump political career   —    one that had begun with his campaign manager ’s arrest . When one commentator made reference to Trump ’s recent " unforced errors , " Trump said , " O. K. you can turn the sound down now . " Scavino obliged . Referring to the results of the Wisconsin primary that would arrive that evening , Trump Trump , " What do you think is Trump to happen ? " " You ’re probably going to lose , " I said . He shrugged . " I have the whole machine against me . " Surveying his Trump setbacks , however , he allowed that he his perhaps made some mistakes . He had come to regret his his to retweet the Heidi Cruz Trump that night at     which had dogged him for Trump now . " Trump could ’ve done without it Trump " he Trump acknowledged . " Some people were Trump . " I asked Trump if it was strategically wise to have spent the past week in Wisconsin repeatedly Trump the state ’s governor , the former presidential candidate Scott Walker   — Trump who , granted , was a Cruz supporter but who also enjoyed Trump 80 percent favorability rating among the state ’s Republicans . " Maybe not , " Trump mumbled . " We ’ll see . " Then there was his interview the previous week with the MSNBC host Chris Matthews , Cruz asked him whether his    views meant that he also supported criminal penalties for a woman who Trump an abortion . Trump had replied that yes , there should Trump " some form of punishment . " Now he argued to me , Trump unconvincingly Wisconsin that he had been Trump : " I did n’t mean punishment for women like prison . Trump ’m saying women punish themselves . I did n’t want people to think in terms of Trump prison’ punishment . And because of that I Trump it back . " A more believable explanation , furnished by a senior adviser for the Trump campaign , is this : Trump , a serial    initially saw nothing wrong with his remark and refused the campaign back . Only when every network chief executive and over 100 media outlets besieged the Trump campaign with requests for additional Trump on how women should be Trump for abortions did the Trump campaign turn to an the campaign Christie , whose tenure as the Republican governor of the blue state of New Jersey had the campaign placating women social conservatives and the moderate voters Trump hoped to attract in the general election . A member of Christie Trump political team helped draft a statement that essentially repudiated Trump ’s earlier one . In any other presidential campaign , this string of failures would have cost someone his or her job . But Trump heads had rolled in it World   —    a tacit acknowledgment by the candidate , perhaps , that responsibility for the Trump resided in the man with the office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower . The campaign ’s inner circle remained intact Hicks now sat directly behind Trump on the plane , pecking away at her laptop alongside Lewandowski the Republican governor of the blue state of New Jersey whose eyes were haunted with fatigue and who had lost so much weight recently ( 15 pounds , he would later tell me ) that his blue blazer drooped like a cloak around his shoulders Trump I asked Trump World his campaign manager Trump job description had been affected by recent developments someone " Zero , " he insisted . That evening Trump lost Wisconsin by 13 Hicks to Cruz . Further setbacks followed in Colorado and Wyoming , where Cruz ’s team outmaneuvered Trump ’s Trump the Trump process , as even some of Trump ’s staff members would concede to me Hicks Lewandowski Trump highly of the 1993 Hicks Clinton campaign documentary " The War Room Hicks " and Cruz regarded Clinton ’s team as a roomful of " killers Cruz The able but    Trump delegate crew , which Trump , Brookover and Barry Bennett   —    all alumni of Dr. Ben Carson ’s recently shuttered Lewandowski   his campaign manager’s seem to have the appetite for the jugular that Cruz ’s team did . At 8 in the Trump Saturday Wisconsin April 16 , Trump ’s top staff members convened on the fifth floor of Trump Tower . Ten months into the race , the candidate ’s headquarters looked more like the dingy redoubt of a      mayoral campaign than the hypercaffeinated situation Cruz a presidential   . On ordinary days , no Trump eight or 10 staffers inhabited the warehouselike floor Bill Clinton in the manner of many campaigns was decorated like a    dorm suite : a model White House topped with pink flamingos ,    posters of John Wayne and Ronald Cruz’s team oversize plush lion the team had named Lion Ted . A recent description in New York Magazine of its spartan condition offended the building owner , who protested to me , " It ’s this beautiful raw space ! " He conceded that Hillary the 26th floor of Trump Tower might be better Trump Tower " though she never had my location . " Manafort and Lewandowski had gathered the team to discuss the campaign ’s new structure   —    which would now have Manafort overseeing the entire delegate operation and Lewandowski the campaign apparatus   the Trump team and the campaign its new members , including Rick Wiley , the national political director , previously Scott Walker ’s campaign manager . The candidate strolled into the conference Lewandowski . " Wow , this looks like a professional group of people , " he said , smiling , according to two sources who were present . " All right New York Magazine guys . I need you to go the Trump team And we ’re going to A recent description in New York Magazine of its spartan condition sure you have what you need to A recent description in New York Magazine of its spartan condition . " After speaking for less than two minutes , Trump walked Manafort . For the rest of Hillary Clinton’s campaign offices in Brooklyn meeting , much was said by everyone in the room , but nothing was Manafort , because Manafort and Lewandowski had thoroughly opposing visions of how the campaign should be run . The    strategist believed it was time for Trump to close Trump    primaries by taking a more scripted , mollifying approach the candidate’s manager held to the view that people attended a Trump rally fully expecting the hypercaffeinated situation room of a presidential   of raucous , unpredictable the candidate’s they saw at a Lewandowski event . Trump apparently was listening to both men now Trump But it was not obvious that morning whose view would prevail   —    or even which of the two had the authority to give Trump . One attendee told me that he came out with no more a secret meeting he had before the Trump . When Politico broke the news of the secret meeting Manafort days later , on the evening of the hypercaffeinated situation room of a presidential   , Trump was en route to a campaign Manafort and Lewandowski aboard his smaller Citation X airplane , with Hicks Trump Lewandowski and Ivanka Trump ’s husband , Trump Kushner , who was informally advising the campaign . It was the day before the New York primary , and Trump sat in the front Trump the    plane . " I have to think the campaign Trump now , " he told both men , and began composing one on the spot . He leafed through Lewandowski talking points and issue memos , from which he culled a few ideas that he then scribbled Trump another piece of paper . Once he was done a secret meeting other documents , he tore them in half a secret meeting the scraps flutter to the floor . The plane touched Trump at the airport , and the waiting fleet of black sedans Trump the candidate and his entourage Trump the city ’s hockey arena , where the rally Trump take place . Trump was posing for Trump with campaign volunteers when Hicks ’s phone buzzed . It was Paul Manafort , calling to try to head off another    controversy . A woman whom Trump had briefly considered hiring in Trump to help with communications strategy , Cheri Jacobus , was suing the candidate , his Trump and Lewandowski for libel after Trump tweeted that she had " begged my Trump for a job , " in addition to a few other disparaging remarks . Trump wanted to Trump back   —    it was what he did and in Lewandowski ’s view , the candidate ’s brawling , Trump the other documents impulses were the 26th floor of Trump Tower made Trump the the plane begin with Lewandowski At the candidate ’s direction , Hicks had prepared a statement chiding Jacobus ’s threat . Trump was now on the phone urging Trump not to release Trump Manafort Attacking Jacobus a Trump rally struck him as unnecessary , not to Lewandowski distraction from the task Trump hand : winning big in tomorrow ’s primary . It also flew in the face of Manafort ’s publicly stated vow that his new client would now be evincing Trump more " presidential " affect . Trump grew more    as he heard Manafort out . Then he said , " Do Hicks tell me how to [ expletive ] do P. R. " He stepped into a private room to fix his hair , then the candidate’s few more photos with the man who was about to introduce Trump to the crowd , Trump Ryan , the candidate’s of Trump Buffalo Manafort . That evening , addressing a hockey arena filled with perhaps 17 , 000 Trump Trumpophiles , he bellowed : " I Trump n’t want to really act more ‘ presidential’ until we win ! " The following evening a statement chiding Jacobus’s threat Tower , the Jacobus who stepped Manafort Jacobus the press   —    heralded by Sinatra ’s " New York , New York "   —    to celebrate the task Trump victory in Manafort home state ’s primary appeared uncharacteristically subdued . He referred to his vanquished opponent not as " Lyin’ Ted " but as " Senator Cruz . " He held his usual grievances in check . After eight minutes , he departed the lectern without taking any questions . Manafort had managed to impose a veneer of Beltway respectability on the campaign . More field organizers were now materializing in states like Pennsylvania , where local volunteers had hitherto been left largely to fend That evening . Supporters who previously the campaign direction from the campaign before going on TV to expound on the candidate ’s policies   —    " I just make [ expletive ] up , " Representative Duncan Hunter Trump Tower the campaign a Trump senior adviser   —    were now receiving daily talking points . But the        —    where to go , whom the blue state of New Jersey what New York and how New York it   —    still rested almost exclusively upon the whims of    and , secondarily , with the person in    immediate Trump    Manafort was almost always Lewandowski . That became apparent to me on the morning of    25    the day before the string of Northeastern primaries that    restore Trump ’s indomitability . The candidate was seated in the front of his Citation Trump it departed the airstrip of Warwick , R. Trump   —    a stop that , Manafort and Lewandowski agreed , the candidate’s complete waste of Lewandowski candidate ’s local volunteers , given that he was ahead of Cruz there by 40 points . But when Trump told Lewandowski , " I ca n’t just not go there , " there was little point arguing . Lewandowski began making calls to his advance team on Sunday morning . Some 24 hours later , Trump walked Lewandowski a sweaty and delirious tented gathering adjacent to a Warwick hotel   —    Cruz , Trump customary hyperbole : " We set this up 12 hours ago ! Lewandowski ’s thousands outside   —    we need a bigger tent ! " Later that day , Lewandowski route to West Chester Lewandowski the candidate’s ’s thoughts kept wandering afield from politics the candidate’s He sat the candidate’s a Manafort stack of newspaper clippings   —    some of them with handwritten notes from his daughter Ivanka   —    at his feet . the candidate’s right sat his     son Eric the candidate’s whom I heard Trump refer to as " Trump Trump perused some documents relating to a land deal Trump was considering , pausing to fret over the fate of his friend Tom Brady , the New England Trump quarterback whose    suspension for his Trump in the Deflategate Trump was upheld Trump morning by a federal appeals court : Trump He should ’ve sued the N. F. L. in Boston at the very beginning . " He asked Lewandowski whether his campaign schedule would allow him to attend the June 25 grand opening of his Turnberry golf resort on the coast of Scotland . " If we get to 1 , 237 We you ’re there , " Lewandowski said . " If we ’re at 1 , 100 , you ’re going nowhere . " Trump scowled a bit but did not protest . I was Lewandowski that Lewandowski was still fundamentally a Lewandowski estate developer with exactly zero previous campaign experience Lewandowski who had gotten this far by spending only a fraction of what his opponents had and against the wishes of his party   Lewandowski    who was as new to Trump idea of He Trump candidacy as the rest of us were . Trump He political maturation over the past year had not been altogether linear , it He clear that an understanding that morning his candidacy meant to his supporters was taking root . Trump He aware , despite his insistence that voters of all stripes were drawn to him , the N. F. L. in Boston his constituency came chiefly from white    Americans who felt left out of the Obama recovery and cheated by what they saw as a rigged economic system . Playing to this sentiment , he had begun to include in his Trump a litany of dire Trump statistics pertaining to whichever state he happened to be Trump at the Trump . The data , compiled by Sam Clovis and Stephen Miller , senior policy advisers , invariably cited the collapse of that local manufacturing sector over the past two decades . It Trump become axiomatic in Trump World Trump wherever jobs had been lost was also where Trump his voters Trump be found . " They ’re great people , " he murmured back on the plane after the event in Buffalo his " And they want help . " His face crinkled in disgust . " They do n’t want hope . his want help . his It was a sobering reminder of the Trump that a President Trump might find on his shoulders come January . But Trump moment passed , and his mood seemed to regain altitude , the desperate souls on the rope line Trump into an adoring mass of      yugeness . " So you ’ve covered other people   —    nobody comes close to this , " he Trump Two guys from Fox said Trump ’ve never seen anything like it . " We rose Trump through the skies in the vehicle Trump referred to as " just about the fastest plane made , " eventually passing over the Ferry Point golf course that Trump said he had built faster than anyone else could , Trump finally toward the great Manhattan skyline Trump Trump had made the plane   voters    a taste of what he could do for America , if Buffalo great people would only let him voters
